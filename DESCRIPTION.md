## HWMonitor

HWMonitor is a hardware monitoring program that aggregates several data points from from your PC hardware's sensors, and enables easy tracking of current and some historical (minimum and maximum) values, which can optionally be saved for future reference. These can be useful for performance tests, benchmarks, and troubleshooting.
